Details
The guest record is stored in hotel database which contains customer identity, his address, check in time, check out time, etc.
# OBJECTIVE: 
The main objective is to create a centralized system for a chain of hotels. Centralized System contains all the rates of each hotel room depending on whether it is peak season/offseason.  Customer must pay the bill during check-out for all the services used. Customer can make reservations and pay before check-in. Cancellation charges will be applied if not canceled before check-in time.  A single customer can have multiple reservations in a single booking. customers can check out whenever they want to, but extending their stay is subject to availability. Customers can update their reservations before checkin.

The database has 11 different entities with many other attributes that help us understand what data hotel stores to smoothen the day-to-day activities.
